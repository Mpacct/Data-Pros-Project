#
  ## **Description**:
  ### Our project is a simple calendar API that can be used to create a login and add, save, and edit events saved to a day. 

  ### **Purpose**: The purpose of this project was to create a full-stack website by creating a server-side API, giving users the ability to login (user authentication), and connecting to a database.

  ### **Solution**: Our project solves the issue of having an overwhelming calendar overloaded with options. Our design is simple and minimalistic. 

  ### **Learning Point**: We learned the importance of dual coding when debugging and using routes to implement a database.
